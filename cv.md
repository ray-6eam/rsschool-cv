# About Me
Hello everyone! I'm a beginner Front End developer and I am very happy that I can pursue this exciting career. I realize that there is still much to learn and improve, but I am ready for hard work and self-education.
I know that Front End development is not only about creating an interesting and functional user interface, but also about understanding how web technology works and how it can be used to achieve specific goals.
I will learn everything I need to know to become an excellent Front End developer, studying programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and practicing my skills on real projects.
I know that I still have a lot of work and challenges ahead, but I am ready for it and will continue to learn and grow in my profession.
